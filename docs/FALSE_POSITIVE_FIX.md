# False Positive Fix - Trusted Domain Whitelist

## Problem
The URL `https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys` was incorrectly flagged as phishing with 92.89% confidence. This is a legitimate Google service (Google AI Studio API keys page), but the ML model was flagging it as phishing due to patterns in the URL path like "api-keys".

## Solution
Implemented a **trusted domain whitelist** system that checks if a URL belongs to a known legitimate organization before running ML prediction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `backend/utils/trusted_domains.py`
- Added a comprehensive list of trusted domains from major tech companies, cloud providers, social media platforms, etc.
- Includes Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, GitHub, and many other legitimate services
- Implemented `is_trusted_domain()` function with subdomain matching (e.g., `mail.google.com` matches `google.com`)

### 2. Updated `backend/utils/url_features.py`
- Added import for `is_trusted_domain` function
- Modified `extract_features()` to include domain trust information

### 3. Updated `backend/app.py`
- **`/api/predict` endpoint**: Added domain trust check before ML prediction
  - If domain is trusted, immediately return `is_phishing: false` with 99% confidence
  - Skips ML model prediction entirely for trusted domains
  - Stores result in database with `domain_trusted: true` flag
  
- **`/api/predict/bulk` endpoint**: Same trust checking logic for bulk URL scanning
  - Improves performance by skipping ML prediction for trusted domains

## Results

### Before Fix
```
URL: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
Classification: PHISHING
Confidence: 92.89%
Status: FALSE POSITIVE ❌
```

### After Fix
```
URL: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
Domain: aistudio.google.com
Is Trusted: YES
Classification: LEGITIMATE
Confidence: 99%
Reason: Trusted domain
Status: CORRECT ✅
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates False Positives**: Legitimate websites from known organizations are no longer flagged
2. **Faster Processing**: Trusted domains skip ML prediction, reducing response time
3. **Better User Experience**: Users won't see warnings for legitimate sites like Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add more trusted domains to the whitelist

## Testing
All tests passed (11/11):
- ✅ Google services (AI Studio, Cloud Console, Gmail)
- ✅ Microsoft services (Azure, GitHub)
- ✅ Amazon services (AWS Console)
- ✅ Other trusted sites (Stack Overflow, Netflix)
- ✅ Suspicious domains correctly identified as untrusted

## Trusted Domains Included
The whitelist includes 100+ trusted domains from:
- **Tech Giants**: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon
- **Social Media**: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit
- **Development**: GitHub, Stack Overflow, npm, PyPI
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Netlify, Vercel
- **E-commerce**: eBay, Etsy, Shopify, PayPal, Stripe
- **Media**: Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Twitch
- **Education**: Coursera, Udemy, Khan Academy, major universities
- And many more...

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing domain reputation API integration
- Add user feedback mechanism to improve whitelist
- Implement caching for domain trust checks
- Add configuration file for easier domain list management
